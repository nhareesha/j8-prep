	 Variables:
	 	1. Variable is a piece of name that stores the data in the memory.
	 	
	 Multiple Variables in same statement:
	 
	 	1. We can declare and initialize multiple variables in same line as long they are of same 
	 		data type.
	 		
	 		Ex : int i,j;
	 			 int i=0,j;
	 			 int i , j=20;
	 			 
	 		
	 	2. Multiple variable declarations should be separated by  a comma and should have same type.
	 	
	 	3. Semicolon separates statements in java.
	 	
	 Identifier Naming Rules:
	 
	 	1. Name must begin with letter or symbol $ _
	 	
	 	2. Subsequent characters after the first letter can be numbers, letters, $ _
