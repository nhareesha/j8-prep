	Polymorphism:
		1. A java object may be accessed using a reference with same type as object, a reference 
			that is super class of object, or a reference that defines an interface the object 
			implements,either directly or through a superclass.
			
		2. Once object has been assigned to a new reference type, only the methods and variables
			available on the reference type are called on the object without an explict cast
			
			Eg: Object obj = new String();
				obj is the reference
				Object is the reference type
				new String() is actual object
				
		3. In java all objects are accessed by reference, as a developer we never have direct access
			to the object itself
			
		4.
