	 Default Methods:
	 	
	 	1. A default method is a method defined within an interface with default keyword
	 		in which a method body is provided.
	 	 
	 	2. Default method within an interface defines a method with a default implementation.
	 	
	 	3. Default methods are introduced in java 8 to help with code development and backward compatibility.
	 	
	 	4. If an interface is implemented by n number of classes and there is any update to interface
	 		then all the classes would break and are forced to implement the added method.So
	 		to avoid this a default method is put so that , which ever classes needs it can implement
